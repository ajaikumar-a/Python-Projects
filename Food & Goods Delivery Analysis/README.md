# Food & Goods Delivery Analysis

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to conduct an analysis of the food & goods delivery data of a delivery business called "Delivery Center",  to answer various business questions related to customer preferences, order volume, delivery time, cost, and payment methods. By analyzing these datasets, we can identify key insights that can help the business optimize its operations, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

## Data description

The analysis is based on seven datasets:

- Channels ==> contains information about the delivery channels where the goods and food of retail partners are sold.

- Deliveries ==> contains information about deliveries made by the delivery drivers of the Delivery Center.

- Drivers ==> contains information about delivery drivers who operate from Delivery Center hubs and make deliveries to customers when an order is processed.

- Hubs ==> contains information about the hubs of Delivery Center, which are the centers of distribution for orders and from where deliveries are made.

- Orders ==> contains information about the orders processed through the Delivery Center platform during the year 2021.

- Payments ==> contains information about the payments made to Delivery Center.

- Stores ==> contains information about retail partners who use the Delivery Center platform to sell their goods and/or food on marketplaces.

Each dataset provides specific information related to the delivery process, including order and payment details, delivery drivers' information, and hub locations. By combining and analyzing these datasets, we can gain insights into various aspects of the delivery process, such as delivery times, delivery costs, payment methods, and order volume.

## Methodology

The analysis involved several steps. 

First, the datasets were cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality and consistency. Data cleaning involved handling duplicate records, null records, inconsistencies, format errors, misspellings, and data type conversions.

Then, performed exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and trends in the data. 

Next, conducted statistical analysis to answer the business questions posed. Finally, interpreted the results and provided insights based on the analysis. 

The Python programming language and various data analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Datetime, etc.)  were used throughout the analysis process.

## Objectives

The following are the business questions to be answered through this analysis: 

1. What are the most popular delivery channels among customers?

2. Which hubs have the highest and lowest order volume?

3. What are the most popular store segments among customers?

4. What is the average delivery time for different delivery channels?

5. How does the delivery distance affect the delivery cost and delivery time?

6. Which payment methods are most frequently used by customers?

7. How do the delivery distance and delivery status affect the drivers' earnings?

8. How does the order amount affect the delivery fee and delivery cost?

9. How does the delivery cost vary with respect to the day of the week?

10. Is there a significant difference in the average order amount between different payment methods?
